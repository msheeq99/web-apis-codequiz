# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## my Task

For this project I had to make a code quiz by using all the skills i have learned so far.

● I first started off by making a simple HTML page and styled it with CSS

● I then made a function so that when you click on start the timer starts

● Then I declared a variable named score and made a function for when the timer ends and it says game over.

● Then I made functions and stored the scores on local storage.

● Then I made a function so that it clears the score name and value in the local storage if the user selects 'clear score'.

● Finally I made an array of the quiz questions/answers and made it loop through the questions
